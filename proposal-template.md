# Introduction

* This is a web-based application using java MVC framework. The working model of this project would be ordering the food items 
  form the restaurants from their preferred location. They can be able to add and update the location preferences. 
  They can easily order the food they desire. This application provide users can store the cart items for 2 days of their choices.


# Anticipated Technologies

* To develop this web-based application, we are planning to code in java MVC method. Because it has 
  In built API methods and web pages we can use the JSP model where we can get the entity and controller model.
* To create the front end of the application we can use the HTML for the structure and the Design we are planning to use the 
  CSS methods. And adding the Bootstrap for the responsive webpages for the application.
* In the user creation we need to create signup pages for registering the new users. There we are planning to use the 
  Java script for the validation of password and age and Email validations. We are intended to use the jQuery also if any extra validation would be needed.
* In the java spring environment, the MVC method was using the approach of Entity Relation Database model where we can use 
  Oracle Db as a data base with the help of configurations.


# Method/Approach

* To Implement this idea to a model we are planning to develop the web-based application model method with java.
* In order store the user data here, we can utilize the entity relationships  between the entities in the use case scenarios
  and provide the relation like one to many or many to one. We can use controller methods to call the API responses like SET/GET methods.
* For connecting the webpages with JSP model as spring framework supports the jsp method approach we can use HTML and CSS as 
  frontend part and add the JS and jQuery scripting languages for the validations.


# Estimated Timeline
> To complete this project there are multiple key tasks involved to accomplish the task.
   * The proper database design with the correct relationship to be matched between the entities so it can store the data accordingly. 
    The backend code also needs some time due to more complex relationships involved and the implementation of the code could be a bit more and need to test all possible ways to work the application in an expected way.
  
   * The hard work we will put to gather as a team to complete the project by the estimated timelines of DEC 3rd to 5th.

# Anticipated Problems

> The majority of the problems will come in the mid-way of the development stages and the structure wise we are doing good 
  we have set up few uses case diagrams. need to set up more possible functional and non-functional requirements for the application.
